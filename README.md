# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

## Description

This project was a first taste of how to create a project in **GitPod** and then store it remotely for future access on **GitHub**. Becoming accustomed to the various commands of the terminal and how to navigate through folders.

## Technologies used

As the project was only to test the **GitPod** and **GitHub** platforms the technologies used were limited to **HTML** and **CSS**, to create a basic website and learn the convention for website file and folder structures.
This allowed more focus to be placed upon becoming more knowledgeable with the platforms.
